This is shipment Price Prediction aims to slove the problem accurately estimating how much it will cost to ship goods.This is important for companies involved in logistics and supply chain management


Here's a simplified explanation of the problem:

--Business Need: Companies that transport goods need to know in advance how much a shipment will cost. Right now, calculating these costs can be complicated because they depend on many factors, like the weight of the shipment, the distance it needs to travel, and the shipping method (air, sea, road).

--Goal: The goal of this project is to use machine learning (a type of advanced computer program) to predict shipping costs more accurately. By feeding the program data about previous shipments, it will learn to estimate future costs based on patterns it finds.

--Why It's Useful:
